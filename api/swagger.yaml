        \ to support a \nvariety of use cases, including fraud detection, or the creation\
        \ of AI-generated audio responses. \nRequests must specify either the `target`\
        \ attribute or the `rx` and `tx` attributes.\n\n**Expected Webhooks:**\n\n\
        - `call.fork.started`\n- `call.fork.stopped`\n\n**Simple Telnyx RTP Encapsulation\
        \ Protocol (STREP)**\n\n*Note: This header/encapsulation is not used when\

        \ media is forked\nusing the `target` attribute.*\n\nIf the destination for\
        \ forked media is specified using the \"target\"\nattribute, the RTP will\
        \ be encapsulated in an extra Telnyx protocol,\nwhich adds a 24 byte header\
        \ to the RTP payload in each packet. The STREP\nheader includes the Call Control\
        \ `call_leg_id` for stream\nidentification, along with bits that represent\
        \ the direction (inbound or\noutbound) of the media. This 24-byte header sits\
        \ between the UDP header\nand the RTP header.\n\nThe STREP header makes it\
        \ possible to fork RTP for multiple calls (or\ntwo RTP streams for the same\
        \ call) to the same IP:port, where the\nstreams can be demultiplexed by your\
        \ application using the information\nin the header. Of course, it's still\
        \ possible to ignore this header\ncompletely, for example, if sending forked\
        \ media for different calls to\ndifferent ports or IP addresses. In this case,\
